# MNIST_digit_recognisition

In this project I have built a convolutional neural network to classify handwritten digits. More
specifically, I have used the MNIST dataset to implement and evaluate a neural network-based
model for classification of handwritten digits. 

## Data: 
MNIST Dataset

## Software Platform Used: 
PyTorch

## Training and Testing: 
Done in minibatches of size 64, with about 5000 iterations. 

## Training and Testing Accuracy: 
>98%
